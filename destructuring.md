# JavaScript Destructuring with ... Operator

The `...` (spread/rest operator) in JavaScript is a powerful tool that works differently depending on how and where it's used. When it comes to destructuring, it allows you to collect the "rest" of the elements that aren't explicitly extracted.

## How does it work?

When destructuring arrays or objects, the `...` operator can be used to gather the remaining items into a new array or object. This is useful when you only want to extract a few values and store the rest for later use.

## ü•ë 1. Using ... in Array Destructuring

Let‚Äôs imagine you have a basket of fruits:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango", "Pineapple"];
```

If you only care about the first two fruits, but you still want to keep the rest of the fruits, you can use `...rest` like this:

```javascript
let [first, second, ...rest] = fruits;

console.log(first); // "Apple"
console.log(second); // "Banana"
console.log(rest); // ["Orange", "Mango", "Pineapple"]
```

## üîç What's Happening Here?

- `first` gets the value "Apple".
- `second` gets the value "Banana".
- `...rest` takes all the remaining elements `(["Orange", "Mango", "Pineapple"])` and puts them into a new array called `rest`.

**Note:** `...rest` must be the last item in the destructuring. You can‚Äôt do something like `[...rest, last]`.

## üçé 2. Using ... in Object Destructuring

Now, let's think about a box of information about a person:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 55,
  city: "New York",
  country: "USA"
};
```

If you only care about the name and age, but still want to hold on to the rest of the properties, you can do this:

```javascript
let { name, age, ...rest } = person;

console.log(name); // "John"
console.log(age); // 55
console.log(rest); // { city: "New York", country: "USA" }
```

## üîç What's Happening Here?

- We pulled `name` and `age` directly from the `person` object.
- The `...rest` operator collects the remaining properties (`city` and `country`) and places them in a new object called `rest`.

So now, `rest` looks like this:

```javascript
{
  city: "New York",
  country: "USA"
}
```

**Note:** The `...rest` collects everything left over, and it only works on the remaining properties ‚Äî you must extract the specific properties before using `...rest`.

## üçâ 3. Using ... in Function Parameters (Rest Parameters)

Another use of the `...` operator is when collecting arguments in functions. Let‚Äôs say you want to create a function that takes any number of arguments.

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
console.log(sum(10, 20)); // 30
console.log(sum(5)); // 5
```

## üîç What's Happening Here?

- The `...numbers` collects all the arguments into an array called `numbers`.
- If you call `sum(1, 2, 3, 4)`, then `numbers` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- We used `reduce` to sum up all the values in the array.

**Note:** This is useful when you don't know how many arguments a function will receive.

## üçá 4. Difference Between ... (Spread) and ... (Rest)

It‚Äôs important to know that the same `...` symbol is used for two purposes:

- **Rest:** Used to collect remaining items.
- **Spread:** Used to spread items into an array, object, or function arguments.

### Rest (Destructuring)

It "collects" the rest of the elements:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"];
let [first, ...rest] = fruits;

console.log(rest); // ["Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]
```

### Spread (Copy/Expansion)

It "spreads" the items to create a new array or object:

```javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"];
let newFruits = [...fruits, "Orange", "Mango"];

console.log(newFruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango"]
```

## üçí Summary

- **Array Destructuring:** Use `...rest` to collect the remaining array elements into a new array.
- **Object Destructuring:** Use `...rest` to collect the remaining object properties into a new object.
- **Function Parameters:** Use `...rest` to collect all function arguments into an array.
- **Spread Operator:** When not used in destructuring, it "spreads" array or object items into a new array, object, or arguments list.
