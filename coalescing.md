The nullish coalescing operator isn't anything completely new. It's just a nice syntax to get the first "defined" value of the two.

We can rewrite `result = a ?? b` using the operators that we already know, like this:

```js
result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;
```

Now it should be absolutely clear what `??` does. Let's see where it helps.

The common use case for `??` is to provide a default value.

For example, here we show `user` if its value isn't `null/undefined`, otherwise `Anonymous`:

```js run
let user;

alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user is undefined)
```

Here's the example with `user` assigned to a name:

```js run
let user = "John";

alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // John (user is not null/undefined)
```

We can also use a sequence of `??` to select the first value from a list that isn't `null/undefined`.

Let's say we have a user's data in variables `firstName`, `lastName` or `nickName`. All of them may be not defined, if the user decided not to fill in the corresponding values.

We'd like to display the user name using one of these variables, or show "Anonymous" if all of them are `null/undefined`.

Let's use the `??` operator for that:

```js run
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";

// shows the first defined value:
*!*
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
*/!*
```


## How I understand this is: keep checking all the values and return the first defined/non-null value that you find
